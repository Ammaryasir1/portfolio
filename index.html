        <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          I started studying Computer Science in 2017.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the past few years I have been exploring myself. Putting myself into different fields. Always tried to become the best version of myself.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started learning graphic designing in Adobe Illustrator. Done some animations in Adobe After Effects. I tried to mimic the famous Angry Birds game. I lost that project too.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then I had some experiance with video editing. There were lots of raw fight videos of an event that my uncle organized. I made those videos. It required a ton of effort to make it done.

        <h2>👩🏽‍🚀 Projects</h2>

        <p>
          Over the last few years I have done tons and tons of projects by myself but never kept a record of it. I never felt any importance of keeping those projects with me as they will be useful in building up my portfolio and help me getting work. Well now I have started building stuff. I will be updating things on this website and my Social Media and Linkedin profiles. So keep in touch!
        </p>

        <h2>🏆 Accomplishments</h2>

        <p>
          Aside from 100% scholarship at University being a sportsman, I scored 1st position in pistol at 2019 and 2nd position in Rifle Shooting in 2022 tournaments. This is the position in all over Pakistan on University Level.
